            <h2>MY EXPERIENCE OF THE FIRST SEMESTER OF THE WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE</h2>
            <p>I am writing about my feelings after completing the first semester of the Web Development course of Humber College. I am from India. I joined this course because my parents wanted me to do this course. My father had a dream of becoming a web developer but he was not able to fulfil his dream. For my parents, I joined this course after doing a Bachelor of science. The financial condition of my family is not good. In some way, they managed to pay my fees. After that, it was in my hands to fulfil their dream. During my first week of classes I was getting worried because this was totally a new stream for me. I had not even used a computer before doing this course. In India, I have done only theoretical study. I was getting embarrassed but the teachers supported me throughout this four month first semester journey and even now they are supporting me a lot. My good learning abilities and hard-working nature helped me to do well in this course. I have completed many projects and assignments related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and MySQL on my own. During this time, I realised the impact of the technology on our lives.<p>

            <h2>HOW WEB DEVELOPEMENT RELATES TO US?</h2>
            <p>As a web developer, I have learned many programming languages and technologies. Now, I clearly understand how the technology is affecting our lives. In this post, I will be writing about different instances where I feel the technology is being used nowadays. Firstly about grocery stores where people can buy things like milk, vegetables and fruits. When people make payments someone really notices the database that is being used to store the codes of the different things in order to fulfill the payments. That is really interesting how the price is being calculated by just scanning the code. Another interesting example that I have is of the company Give and Go where i work. I was surprised by seeing how all the workers' personal data, their shift hours and their payment record is maintained by the company on the computer. After studying database design and development, it was no longer a surprise for me. Furthermore, the websites which we visit daily are also created by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other languages. We never try to explore these things. After I started studying Web Development, I started exploring these things and I became habitual of viewing source code of the websites so as to look at what logic is being used to create that site. These things exist but people can never understand until they are taught about this or proper information is provided to them.<p>
